* Pull down Gen 7 cries

* TPPLeague
	* Allow challenger to remove pending challenges.
	* Show pending challenges on their challenger screen.
	* Implement Totem Battles
	* Implement Server logs

* Abilities
	* Check for Ability Reporting on all abilities!
	* No Fun Allowed: Ability reporting is wrong on self-targeting moves.
	* Dictator: Change core engine to allow surpressing abilities on unboosts
	* No Love Lost: Implement
	* Cheat Code: OnEnd, remove all extra moves
	
* Test Scenarios
	* Tustin2121 vs No Fun Mantis

* Known Bugs
	* Ganon's Sword's temporary stat boost still happening even when the opposing Pokemon has the No Fun Allowed ability.
	* Pokemon at full health with Sturdy or Focus Sash cannot die from Mine, same for Focus Band/Beat Misty if it triggers.
	* [<Pokemon>'s Speedrunner!] is shown twice when a Pokemon with the ability is switched in.
	* Spoopify doesn't remove added types (this is correct), but the client doesn't show the added types after the types are changed.
	For example, Coryn216 becomes Water/Ice+Dragon after Slick Ice, and Spoopify changes it to Ghost/Ice+Dragon. The client only shows that it's Ghost/Ice type.
